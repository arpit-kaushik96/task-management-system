# Java Learning Project

Welcome to your Java learning journey! This directory contains examples and exercises to help you learn Java from the basics.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
1. **Install Java Development Kit (JDK)**
   - Download from [Oracle](https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/downloads/) or use [OpenJDK](https://openjdk.org/)
   - Recommended: JDK 17 or higher

2. **Verify Installation**
   ```bash
   java -version
   javac -version
   ```

### Your First Program

1. **Navigate to this directory**
   ```bash
   cd java-learning
   ```

2. **Compile the HelloWorld program**
   ```bash
   javac HelloWorld.java
   ```

3. **Run the program**
   ```bash
   java HelloWorld
   ```

You should see output like:
```
Hello, World!
Welcome to Java Programming!
This is your first Java program!
Hello, Java Learner!
Java is 2024 years old and still going strong!
10 + 5 = 15
Message: You're doing great!
```

## Learning Path

### 1. Start Here
- `HelloWorld.java` - Your first Java program
- Read `../docs/java-basics-guide.md` for comprehensive theory
- Practice with examples in `../docs/java-practice-examples.md`

### 2. Practice Exercises
Try creating these programs on your own:

1. **Simple Calculator** - Basic arithmetic operations
2. **Number Guessing Game** - Random numbers and loops
3. **Student Grade Calculator** - Arrays and calculations
4. **Bank Account** - Classes and objects
5. **Temperature Converter** - Methods and formulas

### 3. Next Steps
After mastering the basics:
- Learn about Collections (Lists, Sets, Maps)
- Study Exception Handling
- Explore File I/O
- Understand Inheritance and Polymorphism
- Practice with Spring Boot (for web development)

## Tips for Success

1. **Code Daily**: Practice for at least 30 minutes every day
2. **Start Small**: Begin with simple programs and gradually increase complexity
3. **Read Code**: Study the examples provided and understand each line
4. **Experiment**: Modify the examples and see what happens
5. **Use an IDE**: Consider using IntelliJ IDEA, Eclipse, or VS Code
6. **Ask Questions**: Don't hesitate to ask when you're stuck

## Common Commands

```bash
# Compile a Java file
javac Filename.java

# Run a compiled Java program
java Filename

# Check Java version
java -version

# Check Java compiler version
javac -version
```

## Troubleshooting

### "javac is not recognized"
- Java is not installed or not in your system PATH
- Download and install JDK from Oracle or OpenJDK

### "Cannot find symbol"
- Check spelling of variable names
- Make sure variables are declared before use
- Verify import statements

### "Public class must be in its own file"
- File name must exactly match the public class name
- Example: `HelloWorld.java` must contain `public class HelloWorld`
